See the [Director Integration Summary](guides/DIRECTOR_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md) for an overview, then dive into specific guides:
- [Concentric Circles Integration](guides/CONCENTRIC_CIRCLES_DIRECTOR_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- [Funnel Integration](guides/FUNNEL_DIRECTOR_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)

### I want to add a new illustration type
Follow the [New Illustration Workflow](workflows/NEW_ILLUSTRATION_WORKFLOW.md) guide.

### I want to understand the architecture
Start with [Illustrator API Design Principles](architecture/ILLUSTRATOR_API_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md), then explore:
- [Technical Approach](architecture/TECHNICAL_APPROACH.md)
- [Constraint Architecture](architecture/CONSTRAINT_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Illustration Taxonomy](architecture/ILLUSTRATION_TAXONOMY.md)
